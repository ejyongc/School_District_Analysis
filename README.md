# School_District_Analysis

The analysis should contain the following:
    1. Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## 1. Analysis Overview
The *School District Analysis* was created to provide the school board detailed information that will assist them on the decision making process for next year.  The analysis can be divided into five sections:
  
  1. **District Summary -** Cobined dataframes and calculated totals and averages for the entire school district. 
  2. **School Summary -**  This data frame is the breakdown of the *Districs Summary* data by school. 
  3. **High & Low Performing Schools -** Sorted schools based on the *Percentage of Overall Passing* students. 
  4. **Math and Reading Scores by Grade -** Created two separate dataframes that breaks down *math* and *reading* scores by *grade* for each school. 
  5. **Score analysis:-** Segmented the data to determine the impact that *Budgets*, *School Sizes*, and *School Types* have on the *Scores*
      a. Scores by School Spending 
      b. Scores by School Size
      c. Score by School Type 
  
  In this script, we will start off by cleaning the data due to some academic dishonesty implications that compromised the data, and then proceeding with the *Disctrict Analysis*.  

    2. Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
        How is the district summary affected?
        How is the school summary affected?
        How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
        How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
            Math and reading scores by grade
            Scores by school spending
            Scores by school size
            Scores by school type
